# chatgpt-magento2-module

I asked ChatGPT to create a Magento module for me, requirements
- create a product attribute with combobox values/labels
- block users from adding to cart a product that had a specific value of the previously created attribute

The process was a bit cumbersome and it took a total of about 20 minutes to have this complete code.

Not too shabby anyway right?
